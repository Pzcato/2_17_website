  <div class="mp"><p>Dracula is the title character of Bram Stoker's 1897 gothic horror novel Dracula.
     He is considered to be both the prototypical and the archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction. 
     Aspects of the character are believed by some to have been inspired by the 15th-century Wallachian Prince Vlad the Impaler, 
     who was also known as Dracula, and by Sir Henry Irving, an actor for whom Stoker was a personal assistant. One of Dracula's
      most iconic powers is his ability to turn others into vampires by biting them and infecting them with his vampiric disease. 
      Other character aspects have been added or altered in subsequent popular fictional works. The character has appeared frequently 
      in popular culture, from films to animated media to breakfast cereals.</p></div>
